Project Description

The Shape Calculator is a Python application designed to provide accurate perimeter
and area estimations for various geometric shapes. It uses inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation concepts in object-oriented
programming to provide a strong foundation for mathematical computations. The
software has several classes, each specifically designed to depict different geometric
shapes like Triangle, Square, Rectangle, and Circle. Encapsulating these shapes' distinct behaviors into special classes improves readability, maintainability, and code
reusability. The Shape Calculator is an invaluable tool for users learning about
geometric calculations, as it simplifies the process of traveling between different
shapes. It showcases the effectiveness of object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing users to explore mathematical concepts with accuracy and adaptability.
